### Project Description
This web app is for music fans to rank and discuss music.

- Product Vision Statement: Our app is a music ranking app that allows users to view songs and leave rating and comments about their thoughts. Users are allowed to create accounts and choose to log in and log out. They can also search for individual songs that they want to rate as well as look at the current reviews for that song. Users can also comment under these posts or create a post of their own. Our app also allows for people to view other profiles to see what other posts and comments other users have left. The goal of our product is to create a community of users where they can actively share their thoughts on songs as well as see and communicate with other peoples views. This allows users to not only learn more about songs they might not have heard yet but also receive opinions from other users that may align or clash with their own thoughts.

    Users can:
    * login/logout
    * search for individual songs
    * rate individual songs
    * post written reviews
    * post comments on written reviews
    * see other users' profiles

### Project History and Contribution
As frequent users of Spotify, we found ourselves wanting to learn more about our friend’s opinions on the same songs we listen to. When comparing albums, we would each have different rankings for our favorite songs, and realized that having an app that would allow for us to input this and view other people’s rankings would help make the music listening experience even more interactive.
