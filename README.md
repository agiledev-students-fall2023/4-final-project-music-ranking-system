### Project History and Contribution
As frequent users of Spotify, we found ourselves wanting to learn more about our friend’s opinions on the same songs we listen to. When comparing albums, we would each have different rankings for our favorite songs, and realized that having an app that would allow for us to input this and view other people’s rankings would help make the music listening experience even more interactive.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on project contribution.
