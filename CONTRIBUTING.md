# Guide to Contributing

### Team Norms
- Treat each other with respect
- Actively listen
- Be willing to compromise
- Be open to relying on and helping each other
- Meet on Wednesdays after 6:30 pm
  
### Git Workflow
- We will follow a forking and feature-branching Git workflow such that when a developer wants to make a change or implement a feature, they will create a branch on the local repository, make the changes, create a pull request, and wait for members of the team to review the changes. If successful, the other members will approve the merge request.
  
### Rules of Contributions
- The contributions will be related to the user stories the developer is assigned to work and every developer has the responsibility of making contributions and double-checking that the contributions are valid/correct in regard to the project.

### Instructions for Local Environment
- We'll be using a primarily Linux-focused local environment and explore the possibilities of using Docker.

### Instructions for Building and Testing
